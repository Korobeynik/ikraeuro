The encapsulated products are a method of targeted delivery of nutrients and drugs to certain parts of the body (the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, small and large intestine), ensuring their maximum bioavailability, increasing therapeutic and biological effectiveness.

The basis of caviar load is seaweed. This is a storehouse of vitamins (A, B1, B2, B12, C and D; alginic and folic acids, various trace elements, iodine, bromine), amino acids. Algae help to remove excess fat and mucus. They represent a good defense of the heart muscle of a person. Vitamins A, B, C, which are part of the caviar, prolong youth and protect against many diseases. The composition of the product also includes fish oil, which is useful in the content of omega-3 fatty acids.

The product is based on algae - agar-agar, which are famous for their beneficial qualities. The composition of the delicacy contains such nutrients as fish oil, iodine, omega-3) Low calorie. Due to the presence of agar-agar (seaweed extract), which is used as a base, caviar is given a similar structure and density to the original. And still such component in ten times reduces caloric content of a product.

###### What is imitated caviar

** 1 Appearance **

1. The size of the eggs, the viscosity of the product, the presence of an “embryo” (“eyes”) - all the listed properties are inherent in the simulated caviar of our production, and completely repeat the properties of natural.
    
2. The color corresponds to the appearance of natural caviar thanks to the use of natural dyes that are safe for health (beta-carotene, carmine, paprika extract, activated carbon, caramelized sugar syrup).
    
3. The consistency is viscous, completely repeating the properties of natural caviar.
    
4. Taste and smell as close as possible to the taste and smell of natural caviar.
    

** 2 Raw materials **

* Natural ingredients of European production meet all European quality and safety standards. It is worth mentioning that the product includes high-quality, natural raw materials.
*   fish fat
* fish meat
* betta carotene
* paprika extract
* vitamins and trace elements
* Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids The beneficial properties of which together with the salt of alginic acid make our products an indispensable and integral part of the diet of each person.
* Deliveries of raw materials are carried out at intervals allowing to ensure the possibility of using it in the shortest possible time.

** 3 Useful properties **

1. At the base of the shell of caviar is laminaria - kelp, which, in turn, is interesting by the presence of alginic acid.
    
2. The content of alginic acid in kelp ranges from 15% to 30%. Like other polysaccharides of natural origin, alginic acid has a number of well-known beneficial properties, but at the same time, it is distinguished by unique and inherent qualities only.
    

** Immune regulator **

Alginic acid salts have unique immunostimulating abilities.

They are very diverse:

* Alginals stimulate phagocytosis (provide antimicrobial, antifungal and antiviral activity).
    
* Alginates purify the blood and strengthen the walls of blood vessels.
    
    Hyp allergic effect is especially inherent in calcium analginate, which due to the content of calcium ions strengthens the membrane of specialized cells of the storage of biologically active substances (vitamins, hormones).
    
* Alginates stimulate the synthesis of antibodies of local specific protection (class A immunoglobulins) which, in turn, makes the skin and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract more resistant to the pathogenic effects of microorganisms.
    

So amazing is the “alginate shield”, which helps the body to fight infections and various ailments, awakens the body from hibernation and activates its internal potential, does not allow allergies to manifest.

  

Weapons against old age and cancer

Alginic acid salts are the strongest sorbents of cholesterol and fatty acids, reducing the concept of atherogenic substances in the blood.

Stimulating phagocytosis, alginates have an antitumor effect.

Alginic acid salts have excellent, anti-radiation properties.

The basis of such properties is their ability to selectively bind and excrete heavy metal ions from the body.

Alginates are able to selectively bind and remove from the body, for example, strontium ions and, at the level of the gastrointestinal tract, bind the isotopes of strontium instead of the return of calcium cations, and then remove them.

Under the influence of sodium alginate, the content of radioactive strontium in bone tissue is reduced by 75%.

Alginates contribute to an increase in the overall body resistance, activation of regenerative processes in the gastrointestinal tract and the hematopoietic system.

To clean the body of radionulides and heavy metals, a portion of 10g is sufficient. Spawn every day.
