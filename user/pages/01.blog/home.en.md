Today, the product is becoming increasingly popular, both in the Ukrainian and European markets.

###### This is related:

* with the price of simulated caviar (80% lower)
* with the improvement of the quality of caviar, which is practically no different from the natural.

###### The company offers an improved product of European quality:

* "Kets", "Hunchback", "Trout"
* Belugi, Sturgeon
* "Pikes"

Guaranteed quality.

The presence of an accredited laboratory gives us the opportunity to introduce our own technologies when developing new types of simulated caviar, and, what is actually important, to ensure the strictest input control of raw materials entering the production and quality control of finished products.

###### The presence of the ISO 22 000 certificate (HACCP) is nothing but confirmation of the trademarks:

* Persha Іkorna Kompaniya ™
* VIP DUKER ™

Simulated caviar was produced by technologists on unique equipment using patented (complex, multistage) technologies using natural raw materials.

As a result, the product repeats (imitates) natural caviar in its properties and quality.

  

Production is carried out by a new enterprise of the European level.

A young team of specialists led by the General Director worked and continues to work on improving the existing technologies for the production of simulated caviar.

The company works on patented technologies and unique patented equipment.

The company has 6 patents (4 patents on technology and 2 patents on equipment)
