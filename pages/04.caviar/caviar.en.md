Marine algae are the basis of the encapsulated caviar 

Is laden with vitamins А, В1, В2, В12, С and D, alginic and folic acids, various microelements, iodine and bromine), amino acids. Marine algae contribute to the removal of excessive fat. 
They protect the human heart muscle.
Vitamins A, B, C that are the key ingredients of the caviar prolong youthfulness. Besides, the product includes fish oil, which is quite healthy due to Omega 3 acids.

The culinary delight also comprises of such ingredients as agar-agar, fish liver oil, iodine, Omega 3). Due to agar-agar (algae extract) that is used as the base of the product, the energy properties of the product are very low, while the consistency and density of the original product is being preserved. 

###### Mock caviar is:

** 1 Appearance: **

1. The size of eggs, density of the product, eyed ovum – all the mentioned characterizes are preserved in mock caviar produced by our company, completely resembling the original caviar’s property. 
    
2. Colour corresponds to the colour of natural caviar due to natural colouring matter that are safe for human health (B-Carotene, carmine, paprika extract, absorbent carbon, caramelized sucrose syrup). 
    
3. The consistency is viscous enough, completely resembling the natural caviar’s properties. 
    
4. Taste and flavour resemble the properties of natural caviar as much as possible.
    

** 2 Raw materials **

* Raw materials – Natural ingredients of the European production comply with all the quality and safety standards. It is worth mentioning that the product include only high quality natural ingredients: 
* agar-agar
* fish oil
* fish meat
* b-carotene
* paprika extract
* vitamins and micro elements
* oil acids Omega 3 and Omega 6 
The delivery of raw materials are carried out on regular basis, providing its use within the shortest time possible. 

** 3 Health properties **

Caviar’s casing is made of luminaria – a brown alga, which is composed of alginic acid. Its contents in luminaria amount to 15%-30%. As other polysaccharides of natural origin, alginic acid has a range of healthy properties, which stand it out from other ingredients.
    

** Immune regulator **

Alginic acid’s salts have unique immune stimulating properties. They stimulate antimicrobial, anti-fungal and antiviral activity.

* Alginates clear blood, strengthening the walls of the vessels.
    
* Hypoallergenic effect is particular for calcium alginate, which, due to the calcium ions, strengthens the membrane of the specific vessels’ cells that accumulate biologically active substances (vitamins and hormones).

* Alginates accelerate synthesis of antibodies of the local specific protection (immunoglobulin class A) which, in its turn, makes skin as well as mucous membranes of the respiratory tracts and digestive tract more resilient to pathogenic effects produced by microorganisms. Thus, it is being created an “alginate shield”, which helps the organism to resist infections and various maladies, activating its inner potential and eliminating any possible allergic reaction.


An unmatched anti-aging and cancer weapon. 

Alginic acids’ salts are the most powerful fat and cholesterol acid absorbing agents, reducing the quantity atherogenic substances in blood.

Alginic acids’ salts have the best anti-radiation properties.

They are capable to perform the selective binding, ion and heavy metal clearance.

Alginates are able to select binding links and perform strontium ions clearance, binding strontium isotopes instead of calcium cations delivery, clearing the digestive tract.

Under the influence of sodium alginate, the radioactive strontium content present in the bone tissue reduced to 75%.

Alginates contribute to increasing the overall organism resistance, activation of reconstructive processes in the digestive tract and hematopoietic system. 

To perform organism clearance from radionuclides and heavy metals it will be sufficient to take10 g of Caviar daily.
